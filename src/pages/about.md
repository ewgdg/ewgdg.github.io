  - title: Drink
    description: |
      My favourite drink is coke.
      However coke is not good for my stomach, so I actually enjoy having sport drink for the reason that thinking is quite energy consuming.

      My favourite fruit is guava and durian. 
      Yes, I like tropical fruits.

      Some old games are quite impressive to me including 'Baldur's gate' and 'Nox'.

  - title: Substitution 
    description: |
      I am quite good at substitution or empathizing. 
      The most frequent question I was thinking about as a student is that if I was the professor, what questions would I give at next exam.

  - title: Gaming 
    description: |
      I enjoy gaming very much. My favourite game catogory is strategy or card game. 
      I like to 'gamify' my task so that I am more motivated.
  - title: Reading 
    description: |
      My another hobby is reading. 
      I train myself to read multiple lines at once because I am so thirsty for the new line when I read, espically if I found a good story, like the story of Sherlock Holmes. 
      I spent most of my teenage hanging around book mall. Of course, for the free air conditioning.

  - title: Art 
    description: |
      Sometimes I enjoy drawing, just for the feeling of creation, I am not good at it though.

  - title: Haircut 
    description: |
      Sometimes I do my haricut myself, and I like to challenge myself.
      However I am not able to handle my backside well, I need a photo to assist me.
      If you ever saw myself wearing a hat, that is probably another failure on my way becoming a legendary barber.

  - title: Nickname
    description: |
      My nickname, especially when in game, is 'ewgdg'.
      I simply created this word by faceroll.
      If it has to have some meanings, it means 'creation'.

  - title: Color 
    description: |
      I like red. It stands for life, or HP(Hit Point) in games.

      Number 9 is my lucky number, because it takes 9 strokes to write my name.
