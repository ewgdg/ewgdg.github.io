As a newbie with little to no experience in real interviews, here are some of my thoughts and mistakes on my first interview in 2020. 


**First Impression:**\
The first mistake I made is failing to provide insights on the companyâ€™s products. I did some research into their products, but unfortunately I did not think about it too much. As a result I stammered when the questions came and thus failed to impress the interviewer. The bad thing is that the first impression matters and I gave a poor impression to my interviewer.


**Communication:**\
To be honest, I am not a good english listener as I am not good at distinguishing subtle sounds, especially those blending sounds from linking words. I actually asked the interviewer to repeat his question twice. There is really nothing much I can do except for getting used to it. 

Another mistake I made is in understanding the question description logically. During the interview, I asked my interviewer if I can enhance the data structure of given input, and he insisted that the input remains its structure. I misunderstood the context and added an extra constraint on my solution that I should not modify the input data structure. But actually although the input remains the same, I can instead preprocess the input data and create a new data structure to store the input data. I think a better way to avoid such a mistake is to make assumptions write them down. If those assumptions are wrong then the interviewer can point it out. Do not add extra constraints myself.

**Asking questions:**\
When the problem is given by the interviewer, it is my turn to post questions on the given problem. I failed to ask meaningful questions before solving the problem. This made my solution less robotic and less optimal without knowing the real constraints on input. 

I should really ask for input constraints ahead of time. For example, if the input size is small and the functions are frequently called, I might want to preprocess the input data and memorize some results. 

I should also ask for function prototypes and use cases to have a better figure on my mind. I wasted some time on realizing the correct prototypes with wrong assumptions. 

**Test cases:**\
It is very important to make sure the solution is correct. Test driven development is a good strategy to use here. I should have made test cases before and write solutions based on test cases. Without writing test cases ahead, my solution became error-prone and I did spend a considerable amount of time debugging it. 

It is also important to come up with some simple edge cases ahead. I did not test much on edge cases after finishing my solution as there is not much time left, so it is better to do it first.

**Analyze complexity and optimization:**\
I forgot to analyze time and space complexity after completion of my solution and thus lost my chance to realize there is a potential optimization behind the scene. Thinking about optimization and complexity is another step to do after solving problems.

**Lesson Learnt:**\
A mock interview for a real interview is as important as a unit test for a program. I could have avoided all mistakes I made if I mocked my interview beforehand.
