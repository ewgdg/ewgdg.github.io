Gaming is always the best reward for me. After my completion of my personal page site project, I decided to take a short break and spend my time into playing HearthStone. Within 2 weeks in the new expansion of HS, I achieved my first legend rank for the game. I was very satisfied about it at the moment so I wrote this post to share my joy.

The key to this achievement is on data analysis. To be specific, there is a website collecting match-ups data from HS players named hsreplay.net. By analysing these data, I soon targeting a deck called face hunter to level up my rank tier from 25 to 1. Now rank tier 1 is one level away from the highest rank tier --- legend tier. However, the environment changed very quickly. Face hunter is less competitive in rank tier 1. As the hsreplay.net showed, the win ratio of face hunter in rank tier 1 is barely above 50%, 50.38% to be specific. Players need 5 net wins to achieve legend rank from rank tier 1. With 50.38% win ratio, I need to play n game plays in total in expectation, where 50.38%\*n-(100%-50.38%)\*n = 5 and n ~= 658. It was obviously not a smart choice to continue to play face hunter. Fortunately, there was a new patch arriving to nerf Shaman so that I knew that the environment would be changing soon. If I can find out a deck with high win ratio that is rare enough that nobody is trying to counter against it in the new environment, then I can quickly arrive to the legend rank. 

The first abnormal data I found on day 1 since the patch is collected from China server. The deck was Mech Paladin with 100% win ratio in rank tier 1. I soon realized that this was my chance, but after a few game plays in America server I got no luck. Mech Paladin, though with high win ratio, was not the correct choice. That could just be a noise factor because the data from China server is too little for just a single day (hsreplay.net and its data tracker is not very popular in China). On day 2, I found another abnormal high win ratio with little game plays, 56% win ratio in rank tier 2 for Quest Resurrect Priest deck. The number seemed to be much more reasonable but still very attractive. Indeed, with Quest Resurrect Priest deck, I got 12 net wins in just 17 games and got my first legend rank reward. The actual win ratio I got was ~70%. This was amazing because nobody was expecting the high performance of this deck which was poorly performed in the past few days. People did not know how to play against this deck in the new environment. And that is the power of big data to find out extra dividends from a new patch. Without data analysis, it is too late when people start to realize the popularity of a deck. The lagging of information acquirement can cancel out any possible dividend from a new environment, but if you collect data and make a prediction before the majority then you will get reward in return.
