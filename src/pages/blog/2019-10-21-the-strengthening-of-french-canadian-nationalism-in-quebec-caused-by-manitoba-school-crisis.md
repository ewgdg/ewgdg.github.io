The Manitoba school question should not only be considered as a
religious issue but should be regarded as one involving the relation of
French-speaking and English-speaking Canadian; the relation between
French Canadian and English-speaking Canadian was the key to the Quebec
nationalism. Quebec was a province with the most French-Canadian in
Canada, while Manitoba was another province with huge amount of
French-Canadian. Both the Manitoba and Quebec were the main provinces
gathering French Canadians. In 1890, the Manitoba schools act began to
cut money for Catholic schools in the province. The short-lived
resolution was a major defeat for French language outside the province
of Quebec. The end result of the question was that French was no longer
supported as an official language in most western Canadian provinces
which in turn led to a strengthening of French Canadian nationalism in
Quebec. Although Manitoba was another province that seemed like had not
connections with Quebec, the Manitoba school acts did strengthen the
French Canadian nationalism in Quebec through the bond of the
French-speaking minority between the two provinces because of the
continuously discontent of French Canadians in Quebec, the interfering
with the right and privilege of French Canadians, the feeling of
brotherhood with Manitoba, and Wilfred Laurier's compromise.

The main reason that Quebec nationalism was strengthened is that
Manitoba school crisis in 1890 broke the interests of French Canadians
and thus raise the discontent of French Canadians. The discontent of
French Canadians led to the strengthening of the French-Canadian
nationalism in Quebec later. "The dangers were undoubtedly present --
dangers of poverty, crime, license, and above all, perhaps,
secularization and Anglicization,"[^1] Said by Ramsay Cook. Beginning
with the abolition of separate schools in Manitoba in 1890, the rights
of French speaking minorities were gradually reduced and
disappeared.[^2]In nineties in Manitoba, the privileges of the French
and catholic minority were no longer existed due to those political
acts. The act of Manitoba school in 1890 provided that "the public
schools should be non-sectarian" and declared that "any school not
conducted in accordance with the provisions of the act or the
regulations of the advisory board should not be deemed a public school
within the meaning of the law."[^3] Those schools were ban to
participate in the legislative grant. What happened in Manitoba, 1890
was that under the pressure from English-speaking Canadian majority, the
government of Manitoba in 1890 established public "nondenominational
school system", which led to the abolition of French as an official
language. French Canadians believed that if they exercised control over
their language, they will gain a free religion and will exist as a group
with their own qualities and identities. But it was obvious that existed
as a group with free religion became difficult by economic and social
change of the Manitoba school crisis. Furthermore, this act insulted the
French Canadians by refusing to provide government grant to the French
Catholic schools. Remedial action for the interfered rights of minority
remained inexistent. Under these conditions of insulting and taking off
their interests, French Canadians realized that a new way of survival
were necessary. Strengthening of the Quebec nationalism started.

Religion factor is another reason to the strengthening of nationalism in
Quebec. The Catholic religion was attacked in the Manitoba school
crisis. During 1890, most French Canadians were Roman Catholics, but the
school acts changed the school board system of denominational schools.
Real Belanger explained, "The debate \[of Manitoba school question\] was
concerned with the catholic religion, one of the fundamental
characteristics of the French Canadian nation. To attack Catholicism was
an affront to the French Canadian nationality itself."[^4] French was
deeply related to the catholic religion; most French are Roman Catholic.
French Canadians thought that they had the obligation of educating their
children according to their faith and the religious principles they
profess, so they wanted the right of establishing their separate schools
and the right to have free religion without being forced to pay double
school taxes. It was clear that the Manitoba school act conflicted with
French Canadians' willing to keep their rights. For French Canadians, to
argue against Roman Catholic separate schools were to argue against
French Canadians. It was because separate schools represent French
Canadians' rights to have free religion and to have chance to learn
France. In that, Quebec nationalists responded the Manitoba question
with the strengthening of nationalism. Religion in the strengthening of
Quebec nationalism played a connecting role in fact. The Roman Catholic
clergy resisted throughout Europe to "invoke the aid of powerful
catholic hierarchy of Quebec".[^5] It was catholic who attracted the
attention of Quebec French Canadians and thus increased the discontent
and strengthened the French Canadians nationalism in Quebec.

Manitoba and Quebec were similar in their educational and political
position. The expectation and hope in that period was that Manitoba
would be a second Quebec. Manitoba province was set as a province with
the same political purpose as Quebec. Manitoba was modeled on the same
political structure of Quebec relating to educational control, because
both provinces use "English and French in the legislative council."[^6]
Another similarity between them was that French Canadians in both
Manitoba and Quebec were minority compare to the majority English
speaking Canadians in Canada. The French of Manitoba became a minority
as the major English speaking Canadians turned against them. There was
an assembling of immigrants from Ontario and Europe, but not Quebec, so
that many of the French Canadians left Manitoba. Because of the
immigrants, composition of population changed. Therefore, Manitoba
became primarily English speaking. French Canadians lost their quantity
advantage in Manitoba. The same situation was occurred in Quebec. Real
Belanger referred, "French Canadians realized ... Quebec was a minority
in a new federal structure." [^7] These similarities made Quebec
consider Manitoba as a second Quebec and a model of Quebec, which led to
the concern to Manitoba and made the worry of Quebec French Canadians
about themselves. Because Manitoba was attacked, Quebec, which was the
similar one, was probably the next province to be performed acts of
reducing rights for French Canadians. The efforts to limit French rights
outside Quebec caused French Canadians in Quebec to look more and more
to their own province in anxiety. Finally, Quebec French Canadians began
to worry themselves because of the similarities to Manitoba, and the
nationalism in Quebec was strengthened under the pressure of the worry.

One important reason that the Manitoba schools question strengthened the
Quebec French Canadians nationalism was about the brotherhood between
Manitoba and Quebec. French Canadians was minority in Canada, so they
had to keep them together. They had same interests and same languages.
There was a feeling of brother between the French Canadians in the two
provinces. If one of the two province brothers got hurt, another would
definitely get full of discontent and went to help it. Therefore, in the
case of separate schools in Manitoba, French Canadians in the Quebec
unhesitatingly supported their brothers in Manitoba in a way to
strengthening their nationalism. The French Canadians in Quebec was so
disappointed about what happened to their brother. Thus, in view of the
disappointing outcome, most of French Canadians in Quebec were no longer
"under any illusions about the intentions of English Canadian
majority".[^8] The discontent was existed and continuously growing.
Quebec French Canadians' feeling of nationalism was strengthened by the
discontent and anger rose by the hurt of their brother in Manitoba.

The Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier played another important role and
strengthened Quebec nationalism by got French Canadians more discontent
and disappointment to his compromise and decision. Wilfred Laurier was
the first francophone prime minister of Canada; everyone thought he
would change the situation of Manitoba and bring the rights back to
French Canadians. However, even though Wilfred Laurier wanted to
benefits the both group of French Canadians and the group of English
Canadians, he made a wrong decision and caused the Quebec Canadians to
be more insisted on their nationalism by deeply disappointed Quebec
nationalism with his compromise. By 1896, Manitoba premier Thomas
greenway and Prime Minister Wilfred Laurier had worked out a deal: "
Manitoba could change to a single school system, but schools would give
some religious instruction at the end of each school day, as well the
province would provide French-language schools."[^9] In this deal,
Wilfred Laurier was truly wanted to benefit French Canadians in poor
conditions, but he finally failed because he compromised, and his
compromise was so disappointed that French Canadians were full of
discontent, disappointment, and fury. In the help of the disappointment
and discontent of Quebec nationalism, Wilfred Laurier strengthened the
Quebec French nationalism. Real Belanger said, "At the end, I believe,
Laurier was so eager to compromise at any cost, \[but\] his fudging was
so constant, and his political opportunism was so great, that he was
induced to go against even his own version of Canadian nationalism."
This led to the ruin of the dreams of Canadian dualism, which allowed
French Canadians and English speaking Canadians could have the equal
position in the society. As a prime minister, Laurier's compromise could
be good for the nation, but as a francophone Canadian, his decision
betrayed his countrymen. His compromise finally failed to find the
balance and thus help the majority of English Canadian to invade his
French Canadians' privileges. Ironically, it was Wilfred Laurier who
prevented a conservative government in 1896 from taking action to
"restore minority rights" in Manitoba.[^10] Laurier made more discontent
and disappointment of French Canadians in Quebec and Manitoba. In that,
French Canadians, especially French Canadians in Quebec province,
started to realized that it was wrong to hope Laurier could help them,
they needed to protest themselves and join the nationalism. As a result,
eventually, Laurier strengthened the Quebec nationalism in his wrong
compromise

In conclusion, Manitoba school question was a question connecting French
and English Canadians with the strengthening of the Quebec French
nationalism, which involved the interfering with the rights of French
Canadians in Canada, the brotherhood between Manitoba French Canadians
and Quebec French Canadians, the attack to Roman Catholic religion, and
the disappointing compromise made by Wilfred Laurier. These disrespects
of the Manitoba government to French Canadians in fact raised the
discontent and protest of the French Canadians. However, although French
Canadians fought back hard, they were no enough in their quantity. As a
result, they failed to get back their privileges, and thus, finally,
their continued feeling of frustration erupted and caused the
strengthening of the Quebec nationalism.
