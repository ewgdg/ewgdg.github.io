Recently I bought a Razer huntsman mini keyboard with only 60 keys. I really enjoy the keyboard and like the lightweight design. However, it does not come with navigation keys and makes typing a little bit inconvenient. This invokes my ambition to learn Vim. I have tried to learn Vim for quite a couple of times. Unfortunately, I have not found any benefit from Vim surpassing its inconvenience so far.

Besides the mini keyboard, another important reason for me to learn Vim is socializing. Vim is not easy to learn and it is counter-intuitive. The steep learning curve and high entry barrier from learning Vim actually becomes an advantage in terms of socializing and bragging.



Learning Vim as developer is analogous to learning horse riding as capitalist or learning wining as nobility. The high entry bar blocks people do not belong to the social circle. And Vim is the symbol of senior tech lead.



Many senior programmers are actually believing in Vim as the best and most productive text editing tool. Vim can help to approach other developers. Knowing Vim might open a world for you to land a new job or to pass an interview or to make a new friend.

As a result, I decide to buy a 9-key auxiliary keyboard as a navigation keyboard side-way along with my Razer Mini keyboard. I just can't resist myself from using my Razer DeathAdder V2 mouse anyway.



Lesson learnt:\
Motivation is important!
