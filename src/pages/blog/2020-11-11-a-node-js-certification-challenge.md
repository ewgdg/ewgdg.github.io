I have seen some frequently showing questions during job hunting. And one of them is “do you have node.js related experience?”. The real answer from me is no and this will often terminate the whole interview process immediately. To overcome this shortage, I decided to challenge myself and get a Node.js certification from openjsf.org in a short term to demonstrate my competence in node.js. I am going to record my progress daily on this blog post and measure how long I need to take to get that certification.

On openjsf.org there are 2 nodejs certifications; they are JSNSD and JSNAD respectively. To me JSNAD seems to cover more materials as it is designed for developers who create node.js applications of any kind while JSNSD is for those who do RESTful services. As a result, I am going to take JSNAD; there are 16 courses come with the exam and my estimation is to complete the courses in 2 weeks plus another week for exam booking and preparation. 

The challenge will begin tomorrow 2020-11-12, and I wish myself good luck.

#### Day 1
I spent ~7 hours into the nodejs course today, I completed 40% of all materials.
It turns out that I have been exposed to most of the materials with my personal projects.
Maybe what I need is another certification focusing on restful service. 
It is still a good resrouce for me to review what I have known and to learn something new.\
completion list:\
Node binary, debugging, key javascript concepts, package dependencies, node module system,  async control flow

#### Day 2
I covered events and errors handling in ~2 hours. Current progress: 51%.

---
#### Day 3 & 4
~3 hours\
current progress: 63%. \
complete: Stream and Buffer.

---
#### Day 5
progress: 71%, file system.
