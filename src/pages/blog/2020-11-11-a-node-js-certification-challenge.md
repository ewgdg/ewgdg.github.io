I have seen some frequently showing questions during job hunting. And one of them is “do you have node.js related experience?”. The real answer from me is no and this will often terminate the whole interview process immediately. To overcome this shortage, I decided to challenge myself and get a Node.js certification from openjsf.org in a short term to demonstrate my competence in node.js. I am going to record my progress daily on this blog post and measure how long I need to take to get that certification.

On openjsf.org there are 2 nodejs certifications; they are JSNSD and JSNAD respectively. To me JSNAD seems to cover more materials as it is designed for developers who create node.js applications of any kind while JSNSD is for those who do RESTful services. As a result, I am going to take JSNAD; there are 16 courses come with the exam and my estimation is to complete the courses in 2 weeks plus another week for exam booking and preparation. 

The challenge will begin tomorrow 2020-11-12, and I wish myself good luck.

#### Day 1

I spent ~7 hours into the nodejs course today, I completed 40% of all materials.
It turns out that I have been exposed to most of the materials with my personal projects.
Maybe what I need is another certification focusing on restful service. 
It is still a good resource for me to review what I have known and to learn something new.
\
completion list:
\
Node binary, debugging, key JavaScript concepts, package dependencies, node module system,  async control flow

#### Day 2

I covered events and errors handling in ~2 hours. Current progress: 51%.

- - -

#### Day 3 & 4

~3 hours\
current progress: 63%. \
complete: Stream and Buffer.

- - -

#### Day 5

progress: 71%, file system.

- - -

#### Day 6

84%, process + child process + os 

- - -

#### Day 7

100%, I completed the course materials and decide to book an exam 10 days latter at 2020-11-29. The exam takes 2 hours and I may only use the browser within the VM to open some official documentation from node.js, JavaScript and related node modules. The challenge here is that the node.js documentation is really hard to read without built-in search engine. Without the power of search engine, it means I have to be very familiar with the doc. I can conclude that a search engine within doc is kind of important for the premium feel.

How about the JSNSD certification focusing on for RESTful services? I might go with coursera.org for taking some backend courses about node/express.js; because I feel that express.js is a more suitable tool for that purpose and coursera.org also provides you with certification.

What is next? I plan to practice with my node.js knowledge to deliver a simple microservice, a question answering chatbot.

#### Exam Day

The exam is a little bit different from my imagination but I passed the exam anyway. My certificate ID number is LF-mt7qrutu8t. My original expected time to complete this challenge is 21 days and I spent 18 days on this challenge. Achievement reached: node.js learner; look at my badge earned below, what a wonderful reward for this gameplay!

At this point, I decide to continue my node.js study together with mongo DB and express.js on coursera.com.
