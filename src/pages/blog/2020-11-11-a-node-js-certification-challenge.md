I have seen some frequently showing questions during job hunting. And one of them is “do you have node.js related experience?”. The real answer from me is no and this will often terminate the whole interview process immediately. To overcome this shortage, I decided to challenge myself and get a Node.js certification from openjsf.org in a short term to demonstrate my competence in node.js. I am going to record my progress daily on this blog post and measure how long I need to take to get that certification.

On openjsf.org there are 2 nodejs certifications; they are JSNSD and JSNAD respectively. To me JSNAD seems to cover more materials as it is designed for developers who create node.js applications of any kind while JSNSD is for those who do RESTful services. There are 16 courses come with the exam and my estimation is to complete the courses in 2 weeks plus another week for exam booking and preparation. 

The challenge will begin tomorrow 2020-11-12, and I wish myself good luck.
