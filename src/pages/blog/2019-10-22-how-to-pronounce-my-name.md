My first name is Xian,  and today I want to do a research on how to pronounce it.

Xiǎn is the pinyin of a Chinese character 显, this character in Chinese means ‘to display’.
It doesn’t make much sense as a name unless it is combined with my brother’s name 赫(He).

To be able to read the character, it is necessary to realize that Xian consists of 2 parts, xi- and -ian, and it is thus read as see-yen or she-yen by many English speakers. While the she-yen/see-yen is very close to the actual sound, it is not an exact match. The sh sound is a little bit different from how x sound in pinyin. 

By doing some research, I found that the x sound is called voiceless alveolo-palatal fricative and it does not occur in major English dialects. As a result, the only way to learn the pronunciation is to listen to it. The simplest way is to copy 显 into ‘Google translate’ and you will hear the sound.

You might think this is the end of the story, but it is not. Since learning the pronunciation is hard, I come up with 2 options for people who are unable to pronounce it.

The first option is to read it the English way, i.e. she-yen/see-yen/shen, whatever you like. Let us represent the action of calling a person’s name as a part of a two-way communication model.

In this model, a sender broadcast a message, the name, to the receiver, and the receiver then decipher the message and respond to it by paying attention to the sender. The key is for both the sender and the receiver to have an agreement on the message. Pronouncing the exact sound is hard but recognizing the similar sound is relatively easy. As a result, all of those English version pronunciation like she-yen/see-yen/shen can be captured and recognized correctly by me as a receiver. The problem is solved. 

TD;DR: all of the above is BS, just call me whatever you like. As long as I can recognize it, I wouldn't mind it.

The second option, based on a similar idea, is to have myself another symbol that can represent myself so that both the sender and the receiver can understand it. The symbol I choose is ‘Johnny’.
I know Johnny sounds weird. When I check the dictionary, Johnny has multiple strange definitions like 

> a name for an unknown man, often suggesting that he is unimportant or insignificant 

Or

> A condom

Or

> A gown fastened at the back, worn by hospital patients

.

But I choose this symbol for a reason, there is a story behind it. 
Johnny is not my real name, but it is a name I would use when ordering a coffee or takeout, when the waitress has a hard time to call my real name. I borrowed this name from my friend Johnny. 

Johnny, like many other Chinese international students, was too hurried on having his first English name to really be able to figure the meaning out first.Or it could be the reason that his home stay family was so arrogant to give him this sarcastic English name. Anyway, the source of this name remains mysterious. On the other hand, Johnny is very satisfied with his English name. He likes it so much that he rarely tells his friends his original Chinese name. Obviously his intention failed and people came up with a nickname for him, ‘jie ni gui’(a Chinese name for Squirtle from Pokemon) for how ‘jie ni’ is similar to ‘Johnny’ in terms of pronunciation and how Johnny behaved like a turtle.

Although many Chinese parents hold unrealistic expectations on foreign education to turn their naughty kids into elites magically, it turns out that it does not work, at least the public school is not that magical. Being an international student is very stressful and isolated. Gaming was the most relaxing moment for me. I met Johnny through gaming. Johnny is very impressive to me on his gaming skills. He seemed to be born for gaming, and he was very good at predicting opponent players’ move. There is a special term called game sense/awareness to describe this talent. 
I played games with Johnny and many other friends among which Bill and Tony are another ones. Johnny, Bill, and Tony were the three giants on ‘Dota’ among the group, but Johnny was more capable of that. Johnny was a master on ‘Dota’, ‘League of Legends’, ‘World of Warcraft’, ‘Counter Strike: Global Offensive’, ‘Starcraft’, you name it. 

A couple of years later, I was in university and I rarely contact those who played games together with me back in high school. I hesitated with the concern that what if the friendship became spoiled, assuming everything has its expiration date, until the moment I received an invitation to Bill’s ceremony, a ceremony called funeral. Bill deceased for over-fatigue. He played games overnight without rest until his death. I guess that is not bad if he did not feel the pain, immersed into games. I realized that I permanently lost a friend who can play games with me. Life is so fragile. This reminds me of my high school period and make me value those memories more. My last conversation with Johnny was when he asked me that should him transfer to psychology department if he disliked his computer science major. I told him to go for it if he wants just like another time he asked me if he was able to get admitted to UofT. Since then I borrowed his name ‘Johnny’, and it gives me energy. I borrowed the name in memory of those nice friends and wonderful times. I became more confident to speak out because I learnt that life is short and there is nothing to worry about. 

I knew that that will be a time when I become strong enough and find my life meaningful, I will call Johnny and others again to invite them for a long desired game. Until then, I will be tough for the goal. 

Here is the question of today, do you find out how to articulate my name?
