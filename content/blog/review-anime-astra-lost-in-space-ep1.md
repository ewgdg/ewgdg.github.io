*Astra Lost in Space (彼方のアストラ Kanata no Asutora)* is an anime tv
series released sept 2019. I am very impressed by this
series.



Below is a plot summarization from wikipedia:

> "In 2063, space travel has become possible and commercially viable; a
group of students from Caird High School departs to the nearby planet of
McPa for their Planetary Camp. Soon after the group arrives on the
planet, the nine children encounter a mysterious and unforeseen
intelligent sphere of light; it attacks them, transporting them into the
distant depths of space. Floating in orbit around an unknown planet,
they discover an old abandoned spacecraft nearby. Finding it in working
order, they resolve to use the ship to return home. To do so, they must
cross the 5,012-light-year gulf of space separating them from home by
visiting alien planets harboring life to replenish and manage their
limited resources.
>
> The long and dangerous journey home aboard their vessel, which they
name *Astra*, brings with it new character revelations, strengthening
the bonds they share, and the eventual realization that the stakes of
their journey are far higher than any of them could ever have
realized."



If you ever watched any Japanese anime you would probably notice that
Japanese high school students are the most powerful creatures in the
anime world. Saving earth from ruin is the basic skills they should have
acquired. I am not very surprised when this group of high school
students decide to save themselves from lost in space. I still get
impressed by the anime for many of its details. Today I want to talk
about the episode 1 of this series, \"Planet Camp\".

\"Planet Camp\" explains how these students get transported into space
vacuum. There is a very unusual scene, in which Aries was alone in the
space and Kanata who was the leader decided to save her, I am
specifically interested in.



Let us back to the story. The group of students were lost in the space,
but luckily they all had their space suit equipped and thus they could
move in the space with their propulsion
system.

More luckily, they found a spaceship! They regrouped themselves at the
spaceship and it was at that moment they realized that Aries was still
alone waiting for help with her thruster malfunctioning.

Kanata, the captain, decided to get out of the spaceship to save the
poor girl, with the concern that his thruster fuel might run out. One
thing to notice is that he got a safety cable. Everything seemed to be
fine except the sudden when the cable was not long
enough.

Kanata unhooked his cable and he went forward without it. The problem
came when Kanata and Aries on their way back. They ran out of fuel and
their trajectory is off by 5 degrees. They never going to reach the
ship. The next moment, every audience was shocked. The students managed
to catch Kanata by joining their hands and forming a flesh cable (btw,
this reminds me of "The Human Centipede").

I mean, this is shocking not because it is heroic, but because it
doesn't make sense. Why would people not use the cable they found? You
can see many comments similar to the following one:

> ... but this is super cheesy\... Really? Why the need for the human
chain when you had a rope right there that you could have reeled back in
and re-used? \...



And this is the challenging question I am going to solve today, why the
need of the human chain.


To solve this question, I here make three assumptions:

The first assumption, everyone including the scriptwriter is rational.
Otherwise there is no need to continue the reasoning.


The second assumption, the thruster fuel is transferable. If I was the
designer of the space suit I would make it easy for the wearer to
transfer fuel as it might help in surviving some extreme
situation.



The third assumption can be inferred from the first two, that Kanata
would borrow fuel from others as he was the only one who need the fuel
for the moment before he left the ship. What would you do if you were
Kanata who knew he would run out of fuel? Based on this assumption, 
there is no fuel left for others.



With these three assumptions, it is becoming clearer that why they did
not use the cable. It is all about the precision and micromanagement.
Using the cable could be an obvious and naive solution on the first
glance, but without fuel, it is extremely hard to find the right timing,
accurate angle and the exact amount of initial force to reach to Kanata,
a moving object, in the space vacuum when you have only one
chance.


A better solution, however, requires you to think deeper. What could be
the structure that gives you both flexibility and stability under the
circumstance. If you look into your arm, you might realize that the arm
structure might be a candidate solution to this question. Your arm
consists of three joints: shoulder, elbow joint, and the wrist joint.
Each of the joints will give you some extent of freedom for moving you
arm. The more joints you have the more control you gain. That is why
there are many joints on the robotic arm.

The human chain is an analogy to the arm structure. Each person on the
chain can exert force to the next person he connects to through their
connected arm and each this connection resemble a joint on an arm.
Remember that there is no gravity in space so it is very easy to move a
human body. The human chain makes it possible to move freely in the
neighbourhood of the spaceship, without propulsion.


What a great show from "Astra Lost in Space".

So here is the question, given that Zack is able to steer the spaceship
from ep2, why the need of Kanata risking his life to save
Aries.

Lesson learnt: an obvious solution might not be an optimal
solution.
