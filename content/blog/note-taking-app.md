Recently I decide to try some newly arised note-taking apps. 2 of them I am learning and comparing here are **Notion** and **Obsidian**.

In the past, I tried **Notability** and **OneNote** and stick with OneNote for a while. The reason I decide to escape from OneNote is that OneNote does not allow user to disable free-form canvas mode. The feature is not good for notes required some formatting. Multiple text blocks can overlapped together due to the use of free-form and there is no an easy way to fix it, disastrous.

Notion has the concept of database and it is powerful to link notes, while Obsidian can do the similar thing through internal links. Notion can display its database in various forms and views with customized filters and properties. For example, you can display your tasks database into Kanban view aggregating by status. I found Notion is useful for task tracking and time management. Obsidian has limited power in terms of displaying and organizing notes. One popular Obsidian note-organizing structure I am learning is called Indexed-Mapping Framework(IMF). It indexed notes into tree structure, each note can have a parent note and all notes expand from a root index file. Notion seems to be more flexible though.

Obsidian wins when in topic of data storage. Obsidian stores notes into normal .md format and you can store them to disk, cloud drive, GitHub or wherever you like. Notion stores all notes into its cloud server and user has no option to read them in off-line mode. Notion force user to store notes into its server and it seems to me that there are no in-disk cached files for fetched notes. Opening an image or creating a new note via template might take a short delay for that, it is not a very pleasant experience. If you are serious about data privacy then Notion might not be a good choice as well because there is no end-to-end encryption, not a big deal to normal users.

At the end, I do prefer Obsidian more and I decided to try both for a while, with Notion as task management and Obsidian as note-taking app. I will actively looking for better app if possible.
