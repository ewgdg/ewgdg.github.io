## Background

Almost 6 months passed since I decided to change my note-taking app and I guess it is time to make a review on the tools I used during the 6 months.

## Obsidian

The most touching point of this app is that your note is future proof. Even if one day Obsidian does not exist anymore, your notes in plain text format can still persist in your disk or cloud. Most of the other note taking apps try to prevent users from leaving by either intentionally or unintentionally increasing the difficulty and complexity of porting your notes to a new app. OneNote, for example, featured for its free form note taking experience, does not provide a way to convert those free forms into text, and images are very difficult to be copied to another app. Most of my OneNote notes still reside in it, basically because of the difficulty to port notes.

Besides, Obsidian is more open to the world, it has a large community that can help and contribute to various community plugins. I even created my own plugin to support my style of zettelkasten system.

## Notion

Notion is really enjoyable with its database feature. This feature is superior enough to make me prefer it over Obsidian despite the advantages of Obsidian. However lacking of offline support is really a big concern, I don't want to spend years recording notes and then suddenly have to port them if Notion decides to abandon this product.

Recently, Microsoft is releasing a new product called Loop which seems to be a great competitor to Notion, this add more risks to Notion as no one sees the future. I might switch to Loop if it provides better solution over offline mode.

Another disadvantage is that Notion rarely listen to the community or they are not capable to make improvements. Simple feature like recurring events is kept asked but never realized. I see little improvements over this 6 months period.

As a result, I mainly use Notion for task management, I have a task database where I can insert all todos into it and track their states.

## Why it matters

In short, for the dopamine rewards.

A right note-taking app can help to reward you when doing note taking with dopamine factor. This reinforce learning model can then help me to solidify this note-taking behavior into a habit.

Another example is that with Notion's database, I am more motivated to take actions when I visualize how many todos and ideas I have.
