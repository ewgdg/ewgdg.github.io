<span dir="ltr">This inspiration of game came from 3+ years ago by the
algorithm Depth First Search and is developed by then. Being lost in a
maze, what is the best strategy to survive and find the exit? Depth
First Search might be the rescue. However, not everyone has the good
memory to memorize the visited path. Therefore, there is an ink pen in
game for each player to mark visited path, and that is the initial
design of the game.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">There are hundreds of gods in the world, but not every
god is remembered by human beings. Maze god is one of them being long
forgotten, and one day he decided to revive the fear and worship from
mankind. He summoned a few players into his randomly generated maze, and
only one can survive by reaching the exit first.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">Sam is one of the few get summoned. He is smart and goes
for the tutorial before the game starts.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He gets his first instruction.</span>

<span dir="ltr">He found his exp bar and he is gaining exp whenever he
is moving.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">There is a hidden explosive trap that will be revealed when
close enough. Be careful.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He can heal himself by standing beside the red
cross.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image6.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He is level one now and he can jump across the explosive
trap to avoid the damage.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image8.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He keeps gaining his exp and he soon becomes level 2 and
learns to sprint.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">he found a car and is able to drive it for faster
straight line moving.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image3.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He quickly learnt how to paint on the wall but he has
limited amount of ink so he must use it wisely.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image4.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">Say hi.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image10.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He is level 4 now and he is even more powerful to be
able to fly, consuming energy which will restore
slowly.</span>![](/img/maze-generator-image11.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He found a weapon. It is very chilling to think about
what people can do with it.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image12.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">It is time to start the game.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image13.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">Oh my god. He meets his opponent player.</span>

![](/img/maze-generator-image5.png)<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">“Where is my gun?”, he wonders. He looks around and
realizes that weapon is banned because this is just a demo game.
Obviously he should not use any weapon because he is a righteous hero
like those in movies, not because of the ban.</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>

<span dir="ltr">He found it, the exit. He won, although his opponent is
so close to the final win.</span>

<span dir="ltr">Sam won the game, but the story of maze god is never
going to end. Actually, there are a lot that can be improved for the game.
For example, there should be an aircraft randomly drops supplies for
players. Anyway, this is just a demo game and I 
haven’t touched it for a while. Maybe someday when I am a better
developer, I will come back to complete developing the game. Here is the
demo(Windows 10 only) download
